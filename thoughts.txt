Given an n x n array, write a function that returns the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise

const arrayMatrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
];

snail(arrayMatrix) #=> [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]

starting top left
 - entire first array
 - last elements (top to bottom)
 - entire bottom array
 - first elements (bottom to top)


start with empty array to shovel in numbers
 pop = delete and return last?
 shift = delete and return first?

count length of big array
count length of 1st array
